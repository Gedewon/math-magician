          I remember sitting in my high school math class asking,
          “Why is math important in life?”
          I also contemplated when I would ever need to know how to solve an algebraic equation.
          Clearly, I was not the only one!
          If you are a math professional then you have probably
          tried to find a way to motivate your students.
          Hopefully, these math quotes will help!

          Below you’ll find math quotes that are funny and motivational
          for students who would rather be in a creative arts class,
          and quotes from people who love math…shudder! Enjoy the few dad jokes about math too!
